# About

I'm a Python software engineer at [Evonove][1], lead of the [Google Developer Group][2]
in Perugia (Italy), [conference speaker][3] and [open source][4] contributor.

Inside my company I take care about backends web applications built with [Django][5] and
[REST Framework][6]. During last years I spent my spare time studying Javascript programming
and many cool frontend frameworks.
This led me to [AngularJS][7] and [EmberJS][8]: a bunch of Javascript lines of code used in
our production services.

Former Java developer, I reused this knowledge for Android development. Indeed I never stopped
to write app for fun and pleasure or to talk about this amazing platform.

# TL; DR;

I'm an open source and communities lover... that's all.
