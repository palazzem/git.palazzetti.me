+++

I am a software engineer and computers have been my passion since I was a child. Improving by mistakes, I studied
and achieved first a bachelor then a master degree in Computer Science, a decisive contribution to my addiction to
technology. I have some experience as a System Administrator, that’s why I always keep in mind that **code isn’t
software until it’s deployed**. This often drives my choices in system design for medium or complex software.

Without losing correctness, I like writing efficient, readable and maintainable code because *elegance is not optional* (cit.).
The programming languages in which I’m fluent are: **Python** (expert), **JavaScript** (proficient), **Java** (prior experience),
**Golang** (a real beginner).

Whenever I can, I love speaking at technical conferences to share and discuss thoughts and projects with people.
During my spare time I like contributing to Open Source projects, building stuff and IoT devices for my house,
or more luckily doing trekking with friends.
